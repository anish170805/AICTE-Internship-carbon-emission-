## Prediction of CO2 emissions from country-specific data

This project analyzes country-specific data and develops machine learning models to predict CO2 emissions based on various country parameters. The dataset used is the Climate Change Data from the World Bank Group, which includes data on:

- Greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O, etc.)
- Population parameters (population count, urban population, growth, etc.)
- Economic indicators (GDP, GNI, Foreign Direct Investment, etc.)
- Land-related parameters (cereal yield, agricultural land, protected areas, etc.)
- Climate data (precipitations, national disasters, etc.)
- Energy use
- Health infrastructure
- And more

The project is divided into two stages:

1. Data cleaning and preparation
2. Data exploration and predictive analysis

The data cleaning and preparation stage is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook `1_data_preparation.ipynb`.
